  <b><h1 style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 35px;">WHY SAVE WATER?</h1></b>
  <p style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;">Clean, fresh water is a limited resource. </p>

  <pre style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 100px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">
With all the severe droughts happening in the world, the limited supply of fresh water
is becoming one of our most precious resources. Every person on earth needs water
to survive. Without it, many  of  us  would  get  sick  and  even  result in death. While 
almost  70%  of  the  Earth  is  made up of water, many parts of the world suffer from 
clean water shortage. Conserving  water  is  important  because  it keeps water pure
and clean  while  protecting  the  environment. Conserving  water  means  using  our
water supply wisely and be responsible. As  every  individual  depends  on  water for 
livelihood, we  must  learn  how  to  keep  our  limited supply of water pure and away 
from pollution. Keeping our water supply safe  and pure  will protect the water for the 
generations  to  come. Many  believe  that  our  water  supply  infinite.  However, our 
supply is quite the opposite. It is important that  we  must  not  pollute  your water as 
many do not realize just how  important and  scarce water is. Only 2% of the Earth’s 
fresh supply  of water is locked  in ice caps  and  glaciers, while 97,5% of the earth’s 
water is  saltwater. Conserving  water  involves  refraining from  water pollution. This 
requires the use  of  strategies that  includes  reducing  wastage, prevent  damaging 
water quality, and  improve water management. The population  must save the water 
he has today and provide a sufficient supply for the next coming years.</pre>

  <h2 style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px;">Here are the reasons why saving water is important:</h2>
  <p style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">The uses are endless</p>

<pre style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 100px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">
We use  water every  day  of  our lives. It is  required in almost everything we do. We 
need  water  for  drinking, bathing, cooking, washing, and  other  countless  activities. 
Bottom  line: we need  water  for  activities  and  habits  we  use regularly. If we want 
to  continue  to  keep  our   bodies  healthy,  clean,  and  everything   else – we must 
conserve water.</pre>

  <p style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">Water grows food</p>

<pre style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 100px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">
Fruits  and  vegetables, as  well  as  other  produce, require  water to grow. But if the 
area is suffering from a drought, how will the food grow? This  can make sustainable 
living a difficult challenge as sectors that suffer from drought will become useless as 
plants of any kind will not be able to grow. Without water, the  population will  starve 
to death.</pre>

  <p style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">It protects our ecosystem and wildlife</p>

<pre style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 100px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">
Humans are not the only species on Earth  that  requires  water  for survival. In fact, 
every species on this planet  needs  water  to  live  and survive. Without  water, the 
aquatic life  will  stand  no  chance  of survival. It is  highly  important  that  we save 
water that is essential to our sustainability.</pre>

  <p style="padding-left: 100px; font-size: 20px; color: black;">Less water usage means more savings</p>

<pre style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 100px; color: rgb(77, 77, 77);">
By saving water, this allows  us  to save  more water, especially  on  our  water  bill. 
By practicing basic water conservation tips, you can save more than hundreds and 
thousands of water every year. Use less water,and you will be charged less money
from the water company.</pre>
